            <h3>Role of Purchasing Department</h3>
            <p>The Purchasing Department is responsible for managing and overseeing the acquisition of raw materials. After receiving and reviewing a request from Human Resources, the department will decide whether to approve it based on current needs and supplier availability. Additionally, it monitors the delivery process to ensure materials arrive accurately and in good condition at the store.</p>
